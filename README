# chmac

## Description

`chmac` is a command-line tool for changing the MAC address of a
network device.

## Features

-   Supports both `eth` and `wlan` devices (i.e., wired and wireless
    network devices).
-   Follows IEEE 802 standard for a MAC address (LSB of left-most byte
    must be zero) so that a valid MAC is generated in one pass.
-   Does a check on the new MAC address before releasing its
    associated device to make sure the changed MAC address is in
    effect.
-   Keeps a history of previous MAC addresses in case one needs to
    revert to a particular MAC in the future.
-   Optionally, updates the relevant Network Manager system
    connections file with the changed MAC address so that the change
    is preserved in case the connection is reset. Also optionally,
    disables auto connect to make sure, upon next connection to the
    same access point, no connection is established before a desired
    MAC address is set. (This feature works only if you use Network
    Manager to manage your network connections.)

## Download

First clone the repository for this project and make sure the
scripts are executable.

    mkdir ~/software && cd software
    git clone https://bitbucket.org/0mid/chmac.git
    chmod u+x ~/software/chmac/{chmac.sh,chkeyval.sh,lscmdoutput.sh}

Then, invoke `chmac.sh` as root. Remember that, if it's functioning
sanely, `sudo` sanitizes the `$PATH` environment variable, so if
you use `sudo`, you need to provide the full path to where you put
`chmac.sh`, e.g.

    sudo ~/software/chmac/chmac.sh

even if `~/software/chmac` is on your `$PATH`.
